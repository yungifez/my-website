    <p>
      Hello, I'm Marvellous, I build stuff for fun and for a living. I've been in this field for the
      past 5 years, and I continually strive to produce quality projects, each better than the last.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm the creator of the open source project
      <a href="http://github.com/yungifez/skuul" class="text-green-500 underline">Skuul</a>, a
      multi-school management system aimed at stramlining the administrative and pedagogical
      activities of schools.

      <br />
      I love playing the piano as a hobby, I am also into audio engineering. I sometimes study non
      programming related sciences and some art subjects as a passtime
